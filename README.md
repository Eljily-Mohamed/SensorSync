# SensorSync

## Overview

This project involves configuring two sensors and building a user interface (IHM) to review the data captured by these sensors. The data is displayed in the IHM, allowing users to monitor and analyze sensor readings in real-time. Additionally, comprehensive documentation for setting up and running the project is provided using MkDocs.

## Features

- Configuration and calibration of two sensors.
- User Interface (IHM) to visualize and interact with sensor data.
- Data display and analysis functionalities.
- Documentation provided using MkDocs for easy setup and usage.
